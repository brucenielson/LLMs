"Theories are not verifiable, but they can be ‘corroborated’.
The attempt has often been made to describe theories as being neither true nor false, but instead more or less probable. Inductive logic, more especially, has been developed as a logic which may ascribe not only the two values ‘true’ and ‘false’ to statements, but also degrees of probability; a type of logic which will here be called ‘probability logic’. According to those who believe in probability logic, induction should determine the degree of probability of a statement. And a principle of induction should either make it sure that the induced statement is ‘probably valid’ or else it should make it probable, in its turn—for the principle of induction might itself be only ‘probably valid’. Yet in my view, the whole problem of the probability of hypotheses is misconceived. Instead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.*1"

"We say that a theory is ‘corroborated’ so long as it stands up to these tests. The appraisal which asserts corroboration (the corroborative appraisal) establishes certain fundamental relations, viz. compatibility and incompatibility. We regard incompatibility as falsification of the theory. But compatibility alone must not make us attribute to the theory a positive degree of corroboration: the mere fact that a theory has not yet been falsified can obviously not be regarded as sufficient. For nothing is easier than to construct any number of theoretical systems  which are compatible with any given system of accepted basic statements. (This remark applies also to all ‘metaphysical’ systems.)
It might perhaps be suggested that a theory should be accorded some positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the system of accepted basic statements, and if, in addition, part of this system can be derived from the theory. Or, considering that basic statements are not derivable from a purely theoretical system (though their negations may be so derivable), one might suggest that the following rule should be adopted: a theory is to be accorded a positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the accepted basic statements and if, in addition, a non-empty sub-class of these basic statements is derivable from the theory in conjunction with the other accepted basic statements.*1"

"Theories are not verifiable, but they can be ‘corroborated’.
The attempt has often been made to describe theories as being neither true nor false, but instead more or less probable. Inductive logic, more especially, has been developed as a logic which may ascribe not only the two values ‘true’ and ‘false’ to statements, but also degrees of probability; a type of logic which will here be called ‘probability logic’. According to those who believe in probability logic, induction should determine the degree of probability of a statement. And a principle of induction should either make it sure that the induced statement is ‘probably valid’ or else it should make it probable, in its turn—for the principle of induction might itself be only ‘probably valid’. Yet in my view, the whole problem of the probability of hypotheses is misconceived. Instead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.*1"

"We say that a theory is ‘corroborated’ so long as it stands up to these tests. The appraisal which asserts corroboration (the corroborative appraisal) establishes certain fundamental relations, viz. compatibility and incompatibility. We regard incompatibility as falsification of the theory.

(This remark applies also to all ‘metaphysical’ systems.)
It might perhaps be suggested that a theory should be accorded some positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the system of accepted basic statements, and if, in addition, part of this system can be derived from the theory. Or, considering that basic statements are not derivable from a purely theoretical system (though their negations may be so derivable), one might suggest that the following rule should be adopted: a theory is to be accorded a positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the accepted basic statements and if, in addition, a non-empty sub-class of these basic statements is derivable from the theory in conjunction with the other accepted basic statements.*1"

"Theories are not verifiable, but they can be ‘corroborated’.
The attempt has often been made to describe theories as being neither true nor false, but instead more or less probable. Inductive logic, more especially, has been developed as a logic which may ascribe not only the two values ‘true’ and ‘false’ to statements, but also degrees of probability; a type of logic which will here be called ‘probability logic’. According to those who believe in probability logic, induction should determine the degree of probability of a statement. And a principle of induction should either make it sure that the induced statement is ‘probably valid’ or else it should make it probable, in its turn—for the principle of induction might itself be only ‘probably valid’. Yet in my view, the whole problem of the probability of hypotheses is misconceived. Instead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.*1"

"We say that a theory is ‘corroborated’ so long as it stands up to these tests. The appraisal which asserts corroboration (the corroborative appraisal) establishes certain fundamental relations, viz. compatibility and incompatibility. We regard incompatibility as falsification of the theory. But compatibility alone must not make us attribute to the theory a positive degree of corroboration: the mere fact that a theory has not yet been falsified can obviously not be regarded as sufficient. For nothing is easier than to construct any number of theoretical systems  which are compatible with any given system of accepted basic statements. (This remark applies also to all ‘metaphysical’ systems.)
It might perhaps be suggested that a theory should be accorded some positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the system of accepted basic statements, and if, in addition, part of this system can be derived from the theory. Or, considering that basic statements are not derivable from a purely theoretical system (though their negations may be so derivable), one might suggest that the following rule should be adopted: a theory is to be accorded a positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the accepted basic statements and if, in addition, a non-empty sub-class of these basic statements is derivable from the theory in conjunction with the other accepted basic statements.*1"

Instead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.*1"

"We say that a theory is ‘corroborated’ so long as it stands up to these tests. The appraisal which asserts corroboration (the corroborative appraisal) establishes certain fundamental relations, viz. compatibility and incompatibility. We regard incompatibility as falsification of the theory. But compatibility alone must not make us attribute to the theory a positive degree of corroboration: the mere fact that a theory has not yet been falsified can obviously not be regarded as sufficient. For nothing is easier than to construct any number of theoretical systems  which are compatible with any given system of accepted basic statements. (This remark applies also to all ‘metaphysical’ systems.)
It might perhaps be suggested that a theory should be accorded some positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the system of accepted basic statements, and if, in addition, part of this system can be derived from the theory. Or, considering that basic statements are not derivable from a purely theoretical system (though their negations may be so derivable), one might suggest that the following rule should be adopted: a theory is to be accorded a positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the accepted basic statements and if, in addition, a non-empty sub-class of these basic statements is derivable from the theory in conjunction with the other accepted basic statements.*1"

"Theories are not verifiable, but they can be ‘corroborated’.
The attempt has often been made to describe theories as being neither true nor false, but instead more or less probable.
