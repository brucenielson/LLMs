"Theories are not verifiable, but they can be ‘corroborated’.
The attempt has often been made to describe theories as being neither true nor false, but instead more or less probable. Inductive logic, more especially, has been developed as a logic which may ascribe not only the two values ‘true’ and ‘false’ to statements, but also degrees of probability; a type of logic which will here be called ‘probability logic’. According to those who believe in probability logic, induction should determine the degree of probability of a statement. And a principle of induction should either make it sure that the induced statement is ‘probably valid’ or else it should make it probable, in its turn—for the principle of induction might itself be only ‘probably valid’. Yet in my view, the whole problem of the probability of hypotheses is misconceived. Instead of discussing the ‘probability’ of a hypothesis we should try to assess what tests, what trials, it has withstood; that is, we should try to assess how far it has been able to prove its fitness to survive by standing up to tests. In brief, we should try to assess how far it has been ‘corroborated’.*1"

"We say that a theory is ‘corroborated’ so long as it stands up to these tests. The appraisal which asserts corroboration (the corroborative appraisal) establishes certain fundamental relations, viz. compatibility and incompatibility. We regard incompatibility as falsification of the theory. But compatibility alone must not make us attribute to the theory a positive degree of corroboration: the mere fact that a theory has not yet been falsified can obviously not be regarded as sufficient. For nothing is easier than to construct any number of theoretical systems  which are compatible with any given system of accepted basic statements. (This remark applies also to all ‘metaphysical’ systems.)
It might perhaps be suggested that a theory should be accorded some positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the system of accepted basic statements, and if, in addition, part of this system can be derived from the theory. Or, considering that basic statements are not derivable from a purely theoretical system (though their negations may be so derivable), one might suggest that the following rule should be adopted: a theory is to be accorded a positive degree of corroboration if it is compatible with the accepted basic statements and if, in addition, a non-empty sub-class of these basic statements is derivable from the theory in conjunction with the other accepted basic statements.*1"

"The degree of corroboration of two statements may not be comparable in all cases, any more than the degree of falsifiability: we cannot define a numerically calculable degree of corroboration, but can speak only roughly in terms of positive degree of corroboration, negative degrees of corroboration, and so forth.*2 Yet we can lay down various  rules; for instance the rule that we shall not continue to accord a positive degree of corroboration to a theory which has been falsified by an inter-subjectively testable experiment based upon a falsifying hypothesis (cf. sections 8 and 22). (We may, however, under certain circumstances accord a positive degree of corroboration to another theory, even though it follows a kindred line of thought. An example is Einstein’s photon theory, with its kinship to Newton’s corpuscular theory of light.) In general we regard an inter-subjectively testable falsification as final (provided it is well tested): this is the way in which the asymmetry between verification and falsification of theories makes itself felt. Each of these methodological points contributes in its own peculiar way to the historical development of science as a process of step by step approximations. A corroborative appraisal made at a later date—that is, an appraisal made after new basic statements have been added to those already accepted—can replace a positive degree of corroboration by a negative one, but not vice versa. And although I believe that in the history of science it is always the theory and not the experiment, always the idea and not the observation, which opens up the way to new knowledge, I also believe that it is always the experiment which saves us from following a track that leads nowhere: which helps us out of the rut, and which challenges us to find a new way."

"It may be added that a theory makes assertions only about its potential falsifiers. (It asserts their falsity.) About the ‘permitted’ basic statements it says nothing. In particular, it does not say that they are true.*2
We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification. We have introduced falsifiability solely as a criterion for the empirical character of a system of statements. As to falsification, special rules must be introduced which will determine under what conditions a system is to be regarded as falsified.
We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis.1 The requirement that the falsifying  hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the logical form of the hypothesis. The rider that the hypothesis should be corroborated refers to tests which it ought to have passed—tests which confront it with accepted basic statements.*1"

"The degree of corroboration of two statements may not be comparable in all cases, any more than the degree of falsifiability: we cannot define a numerically calculable degree of corroboration, but can speak only roughly in terms of positive degree of corroboration, negative degrees of corroboration, and so forth.*2 Yet we can lay down various  rules; for instance the rule that we shall not continue to accord a positive degree of corroboration to a theory which has been falsified by an inter-subjectively testable experiment based upon a falsifying hypothesis (cf. sections 8 and 22). (We may, however, under certain circumstances accord a positive degree of corroboration to another theory, even though it follows a kindred line of thought. An example is Einstein’s photon theory, with its kinship to Newton’s corpuscular theory of light.) In general we regard an inter-subjectively testable falsification as final (provided it is well tested): this is the way in which the asymmetry between verification and falsification of theories makes itself felt. Each of these methodological points contributes in its own peculiar way to the historical development of science as a process of step by step approximations. A corroborative appraisal made at a later date—that is, an appraisal made after new basic statements have been added to those already accepted—can replace a positive degree of corroboration by a negative one, but not vice versa. And although I believe that in the history of science it is always the theory and not the experiment, always the idea and not the observation, which opens up the way to new knowledge, I also believe that it is always the experiment which saves us from following a track that leads nowhere: which helps us out of the rut, and which challenges us to find a new way."

Chapter: "4 FALSIFIABILITY", Passage number: 12, Score: 0.62
"It may be added that a theory makes assertions only about its potential falsifiers. (It asserts their falsity.) About the ‘permitted’ basic statements it says nothing. In particular, it does not say that they are true.*2
We must clearly distinguish between falsifiability and falsification. We have introduced falsifiability solely as a criterion for the empirical character of a system of statements. As to falsification, special rules must be introduced which will determine under what conditions a system is to be regarded as falsified.
We say that a theory is falsified only if we have accepted basic statements which contradict it (cf. section 11, rule 2). This condition is necessary, but not sufficient; for we have seen that non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science. Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory. In other words, we only accept the falsification if a low-level empirical hypothesis which describes such an effect is proposed and corroborated. This kind of hypothesis may be called a falsifying hypothesis.1 The requirement that the falsifying  hypothesis must be empirical, and so falsifiable, only means that it must stand in a certain logical relationship to possible basic statements; thus this requirement only concerns the logical form of the hypothesis. The rider that the hypothesis should be corroborated refers to tests which it ought to have passed—tests which confront it with accepted basic statements.*1"
